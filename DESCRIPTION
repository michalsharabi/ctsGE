Description: Methodology for supervised clustering of potentially many
        predictor variables, such as genes etc., in time series
        datasets Provides functions that help the user assigning genes
        to predefined set of model profiles.
Depends: R (>= 3.3)
Imports: ggplot2, limma, reshape2, shiny, stats, utils
Suggests: BiocStyle, dplyr, DT, GEOquery, knitr, pander, rmarkdown,
